Source-Code for the example that overrides write comes from here:
http://www.goldsborough.me/c/low-level/kernel/2016/08/29/16-48-53-the_-ld_preload-_trick/

#+BEGIN_SRC c
#include <string.h>

ssize_t read(int fd, void *data, size_t size) {
  strcpy(data, "I love cats");
  return 12;
}
#+END_SRC

Build this via

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
gcc -shared -fPIC -o inject.dylib inject.c
#+END_SRC

Then, create a new certificate and resign Xcode:
https://github.com/XVimProject/XVim2/blob/master/SIGNING_Xcode.md

Next, resign inject.dylib with said certificate

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
codesign -f -v -s XcodeSigner ./inject.dylib
#+END_SRC

Finally, run xcode with inject

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=$PWD/inject.dylib DYLD_FORCE_FLAT_NAMESPACE=1 /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/MacOS/Xcode
#+END_SRC

Success! Xcode will complain it can't start because =Info.plist= is wrong. Which is obvious because read returns "I love cats" instead of anything useful ;)
