I have always been interested in music especially, the production of electronic music. Back in 1994 when I got my first soundcard, I immediately started creating electronic music [fn:: Back then using so called music trackers, like [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scream_Tracker][Scream Tracker]] or [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulse_Tracker][Impulse Tracker]]]
. In the following years, I constantly kept creating electronic music on the side and improve my studio as well as my knowledge. 

Back in 2002, two of my tracks were included on the sampler [[http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Project_Majestic_Mix:_Squaredance]['Project Majestic Mix - Squaredance']] which was a fanmade album of various Square Enix game music tracks, arranged in the style of dance music. This was mostly because I'd been active as a remixer of video game music on [[http://ocremix.org/artist/4292/zeratul][OCRemix]].

After that, I concentrated on my own productions and released them on my web label Sarbatka. However, in 2005 work took over and I couldn't continue music production. 

Now that I am a indie developer I have more free time again so I recently started producing music again, mostly as a way to have an alt hobby that has nothing to do with software development. I'm releasing my track on [[https://soundcloud.com/sarbatka][SoundCloud]].
